# Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying your Oriflame Store application to popular hosting platforms.

## üöÄ Netlify Deployment

Netlify is recommended for its ease of use and excellent support for React SPAs.

### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

1. **Build the project locally to test:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test the production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Connect your repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`
6. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
7. Deploy!

#### Option B: Manual Deployment

1. Build your project: `npm run build`
2. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to Netlify
4. Configure environment variables in site settings

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Environment variables and add:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY=your_sheets_api_key
VITE_GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@oriflame.com
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

### Step 4: Configure Redirects

Create `public/_redirects` file for proper React Router support:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This ensures all routes are handled by React Router.

## ‚ö° Vercel Deployment

Vercel offers excellent performance and seamless GitHub integration.

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Configure project:
   - **Framework Preset:** Vite
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist`
6. Add environment variables
7. Deploy!

### Step 2: Environment Variables

In Vercel dashboard, add the same environment variables as listed for Netlify.

### Step 3: Domain Configuration

1. Add your custom domain in Vercel dashboard
2. Update Firebase authorized domains
3. Update any hardcoded URLs

## üî• Firebase Hosting

If you prefer to host on Firebase:

### Step 1: Install Firebase CLI

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Step 2: Initialize Firebase Hosting

```bash
firebase login
firebase init hosting
```

Configure:
- Select your Firebase project
- Set public directory to `dist`
- Configure as single-page app: Yes
- Set up automatic builds: No (we'll build manually)

### Step 3: Build and Deploy

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Preparation
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Build runs without errors: `npm run build`

- Enable additional security features as needed
- Monitor authentication logs

### Content Security
- Validate all image URLs
- Sanitize user inputs
- Implement proper error handling

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization
- Use optimized image URLs (WebP format when possible)
- Implement lazy loading for product images
- Use appropriate image sizes for different screen sizes

### Build Optimization
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build
npx vite-bundle-analyzer dist
```

### Caching Strategy
- Leverage browser caching for static assets
- Implement proper cache headers
- Use CDN for image assets when possible

## üêõ Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### Common Build Errors

1. **Environment Variables Not Found**
   - Ensure all VITE_ prefixed variables are set
   - Check for typos in variable names

2. **Firebase Connection Issues**
   - Verify Firebase configuration is correct
   - Check if authorized domains are configured

3. **Google Sheets API Errors**
   - Verify API key permissions
   - Check spreadsheet sharing settings

### Runtime Errors

1. **404 Errors on Page Refresh**

   - Check that hosting platform supports SPA routing

2. **Images Not Loading**
   - Verify image URLs are accessible
   - Check CORS settings for external images

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify Firebase authorized domains
   - Check environment variables are correctly set

## üì± Testing Your Deployment

### Functionality Testing
1. Visit your deployed site
